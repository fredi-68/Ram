*Welp that deleted my old readme file, thanks a lot Git. Sheesh.*
Seriously there has to be a better way to merge a local repo onto the master without fucking everything up, even if their histories
don't match up. And there probably is. Remember to propose change to the Git devs to put a gigantic disclaimer text at the start of the
help command output describing how to do it.

I'm not going to send assassins or lawyers after you if you use any of this stuff. But I'm not going to give you permission either.
I'm not responsible for anything you do with any of this.

Mostly going to be using this repo for issue tracking, unsure as to how often I will update it. If Git lets me that is. If it requires me
to rewrite this stupid readme file each time I will just not bother.
